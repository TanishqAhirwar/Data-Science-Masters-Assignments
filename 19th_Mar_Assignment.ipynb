    "5. Set a threshold: Decide on a threshold for the amount of variance you want to retain in the dataset. This threshold can be based on domain knowledge or the desired level of information retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Choose the number of principal components: Based on the cumulative explained variance, choose the number of principal components that capture the desired percentage of variance. Retaining components that explain a high percentage of variance ensures that the most significant information is preserved while reducing the dimensionality of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision on how many principal components to retain can vary depending on the specific dataset and the goals of the analysis. As a general guideline, you may aim to retain a cumulative explained variance of around 80% to 95% or more, depending on the trade-off between dimensionality reduction and information retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the optimal number of principal components for your dataset, you can plot the cumulative explained variance and observe the point at which the curve starts to level off. This point indicates diminishing returns in terms of variance explained by additional components.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the choice of the number of principal components is subjective and may require experimentation and validation with your specific dataset and analysis objectives."
